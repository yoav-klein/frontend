# Overflow menu
---
Use an overflow menu when a space constraint makes it impossible to display all additional options in a horizontal layout, like a toolbar or table row. Overflow menus are commonly used when a UI switches from a desktop to a mobile device.

Here we have a list of users, and for each user we want to have a small menu of less frequent actions.
